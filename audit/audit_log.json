It is common in Active Directory account lockouts, which is usually caused by too many failed login attempts or other security related issues, such as brute-force attacks.\n- The source port is not important in this case because the username is provided.\n- The username is jdoe, which is likely the username of the locked-out user.\n- The password is unknown, but it is not necessary in this case since we have identified the username (the source IP address is more important).\n- The time is important because it tells us when the lockout occurred, which can help in identifying the scope and nature of the issue. In this case, the time coincides with a period of failed login attempts against the domain controller (DC), which suggests that this was a brute-force attack.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven the information provided, the most likely cause of the lockout is a brute-force attack that exceeded the number of allowed failed login attempts. The log entry associated with this IP address suggests a brute-force attack, which is supported by the fact that the IP address was associated with failed login attempts around the same time. Confidence score: 85 (very high). First, it is common for caching to happen when there\u2019s brute-force attack. Next, the number of failed login attempts is not specified by the log. Changes in the security settings of the domain controller (DC) can be used. For example, it can be done by adjusting the number of allowed failed login attempts, or by setting account lockout policies that trigger 2-factor authentication to reset a password.\n\nA recommended fix in this case would be to review any recent security incidents, such as failed login attempts, to identify any IP addresses or usernames that were involved. This information can be used to modify the lockout policies in place to lower the number of failed login attempts before an account is locked. It is also important to change passwords all across the domain if any brute-force attack has taken place. Also, consider changing the DC password if there were any attempts on hanging sessions, which may have caused some inclear certificates authentication or brute-force attack on session.."}
